Required Modules:
---------------------------------
pyttsx [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyttsx] (if pip is installed, use ‘python -m pip install pyttsx’)

SpeechRecognition 1.4.0 [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/] (place directory ‘speech_recognition’ [nested 
under ‘speech_recognition 1.4.0’] in Interactive Story directory)

pywin32 [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/] at this time most recent build is 219; elect the 
32bit version of the software (if error ‘win32api module not found’ try placing all win32*.pyd files in same directory 
as python.exe)

Creating a Story:
---------------------------------
Create a story in the form of a flow chart, with nodes to represent different activities

In interactive_story.py:
     Add your story line to the story dictionary.
     
    Note: If you want your player to contain more data than just a name, go ahead in the player.py and interactive_story.py.
     
In yourstory_story.py:
     Declare each node as an instance of a StoryNode object. This requires a name and you can optionally add a description.
     
     Add connections between nodes by creating parent-child relationships using the .addChild() method.
     
     If some nodes have prerequisites, append the name of the node that must be completed beforehand to the child’s 
     prereqs list. This could either be an arbitrary string or the name of an existing node. Each StoryNode's name is
     automatically set to True in the completed dictionary after you leave the node, but if you want to use a string 
     (to pass data of some sort instead of True/False), you will have to manually append that to the completed dictionary.
     
     Once you have created your activities in theater_acts.py (or another file), instantiate them as an Activity object 
     along with any other parameters. Then, match the activity to the correct node using the .setActivity() method.
     
     Create your story line, which is a list of all of the nodes. The order doesn’t matter except 
     the first element must be the first node in the story. 
     
     Add the line "import yourstory_story" to interactive_story.py
     
In yourstory_acts.py:
     This file holds all of the activities that will be executed during the nodes in the story. Each node has one 
     activity method associated with it. Each of these must take the player as a parameter at a minimum, but can take others.
     
     If you pass multiple parameters to your activity constructor in interactive_story.py, they will become an n-tuple 
     and therefore only one parameter (in addition to player) is needed in the activity definition. When referring to 
     these in the activity, each argument passed in is an element in the n-tuple.
     
     Each activity must return None or a string with name of the next node to travel to. The latter would be used if the 
     user asks to quit, then you could return "quit" to immediately quit the program, or the name of your ending node, if
     applicable (in this case, your ending node will always return "quit").
     
     You should prompt the player to choose the next node inside the activity and all valid nodes are children of the 
     current node. But story.py takes the input, validates it, and checks prerequisites (unless you return the next node
     in your activity, then the story moves directly there).
     
     Add the line "from yourstory_acts import *" to interactive_story.py
