"""This class represents a story which is built from StoryNodes
and a Player. Given a list of nodes, with the first being the starting node
in the story, it is able to walk between nodes. When a node is visited it
is added as a string in the dictionary of the player. Additionally, any tokens
that are prerequisites for later nodes are added. For example, a box office
node, when visited, will add a 'ticket' to the completed dictionary in player"""
